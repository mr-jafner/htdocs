                <h3>Why Python for Mechanical Engineers?</h3>
                <p>Python is a great solution for non-software engineers to get things done. 
                    It has a robust library of tools and a supportive community that makes it easy to find solutions.
                    It is fast (compared to most engineering tools) and flexible for data analysis, automation, and visualization. </p>
                <p>It's similar to Matlab, but Python is free and open source.</p>
                <p>It can overlap with Excel, but Python can handle large datasets and complex calculations with ease - no waiting for a plot to load or hitting the row limits in a spreadsheet.</p>
                <p>Also, due to how it installs, at least in my experience, it is not typically blocked by corporate IT limitations - you're not sneaking, it's just not a problem</p>
                <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> This is an introduction to help you get things done, with the methods I've found best for me - this is not exhaustive nor will it qualify you as a software engineer. 
                If you work through this page you've merely passed your driver's test - you are not even close to being a professional racer. </p>

            <article id="setup" class="toc_item">
                <h3>Setting Up Your System</h3>
                <p>This setup works well for me, and should for you too - but there is no shortage of good alternatives to try out!</p>
                <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> This is setup for Windows machines - process on Mac or Linux will be similar, but different</p>
                <p><strong>Install Python</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Download <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">the latest version of Python for your system from the website</a></li>
                    <li>Run the installer - make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before clicking "Install Now"</li>
                    <li> That's it - you have Python installed!</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Install an IDE</strong></p>
                <p>An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment - a tool that helps you write, manage, and run your code more easily.</p>
                <p>You don't <em>have to</em> use and IDE, but it makes a lot of things easier and faster</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Download <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VSCode</a> and install it</li>
                    <li>Open VSCode, go to the Extensions tab (left sidebar, square icon), search for "Python" and install the extension by Microsoft</li>
                    <li>Also install the Jupyter extension by Microsoft</li>
                    <li>Restart VSCode and you should be good to go - you can customize settings and additional extensions as you want</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Create your first Virtual Environment</p>
                <p>This is another thing you don't <em>have to </em> do, but learn the habit now and it will keep projects organized for future you</p>
                <p>This is a self contained environment for your project (a specific folder with its own Python installation and packages) - <strong>you will need to do this again for each project.</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a folder for your first project - do it in command prompt if you want, or just a new folder in Windows Explorer or VSCode</li>
                    <li>Navigate to that folder in command prompt or powershell
                        <ol>
                            <li>In command prompt/powershell use "cd [filepath]" to get there</li>
                            <li>In VSCode, open the folder and then open the integrated terminal and you'll be in the right spot - see it's a handy tool!</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Create the virtual environment by running the command: <code>python -m venv .venv</code></li>
                    <li>Activate the virtual environment:
                        <ul>
                            <li>In command prompt, run: <code>.venv\Scripts\activate.bat</code></li>
                            <li>In powershell, run: <code>.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1</code>
                            <ol>
                                <li><em>Note: </em>I have run into execution policy issues when trying to run this command in powershell. 
                                    If you get an error, you can bypass it... but just switch to command prompt or use the VSCode terminal.</li>
                            </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>In VSCode terminal, it should auto activate when you open the terminal - if not use the powershell command</li>
                        </ul>    
                    </li>
                    <li>You should see the terminal prompt change to show the virtual environment is active - something like: <code>(.venv) C:\Users\you\path\to\project&gt;</code></li>
                    <li>While in here, let's install some packages via pip - these are essentially python toolboxes; run <code>pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly</code>
                    <ol>
                        <li>These are the packages we'll be using in this guide - pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib and plotly for plotting</li>
                        <li>We will likely install more later, but this is a good start.</li>
                    </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>To deactivate the virtual environment when you're done working, just run the command: <code>deactivate</code></li>   
                    <li>Next time you come back, just re-run the activation script and the environment will how you left it.</li>
                </ol>
